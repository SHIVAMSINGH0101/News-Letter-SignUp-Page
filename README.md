# News-Letter-SignUp-Page
This is a Newsletter signup webpage which I created from scratch by using Express.js framework, body-parser module, request HTTP client module for backend and by using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for Frontend . Here the user can signup with his/her name and email. The information is send to mailchimps servers through their APIs and gets stored there, which I can access this information through my mail chimp account. I created this app as a part of learning making Restful API Requests.
